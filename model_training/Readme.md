This folder contains code for training different models on the *defects location for metal surface* dataset (available on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zhangyunsheng/defects-class-and-location)
Models are trained in PyTorch. In particular, we implement the following models: 
VGG16
YOLOv11

The training scripts as well as links to model weights in Google Cloud can be found in the apprpriate folders
